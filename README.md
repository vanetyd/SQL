# SQL
This is a project I worked on for Database class.

The project consisted on creating the tables, inserting values in them and making some filtered searching.
All in MySQL being acessed from Windows command prompt.

The order you should see it is:
1- ER_APS;
2- creating-tables;
3- inserting-values;
4- filtered-search.

In "ER-APS" you can see the entity-relationship diagram I made about a case that I unfortunely don't have anymore,
so I guess you'll just have to believe this is all they asked me to put in the database (sorry).

In "filtered-search" I chose to:
first, to search who programs in Visual Studio;
second, to see it's historic of salary increase;
third, to know which team it works on;
fourth, to see which projects are from the team's responsability;
and fifth, to know what tasks are responsabilities of the team.
